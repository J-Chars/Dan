  = Q & A =


 Q : Why Dan? 

 A : Dan is a very unique  character in my opinion, and also I was grinding him in CvS2
     and the Alpha series, which has made me grow fond of this character and his playstyle.


 Q : What's his playstyle like?

 A : Mostly a mixture of CvS2 and SF4.


 Q : How do you play this Dan?

 A : His defensive turtling is one of his strongsuits, yet his damage output can be really 
     good with taunt cancels. I would say apply a rushdown gameplay while maintaining some
     form of lame turtling, and also do a lot of taunts as well. That helps.


 Q : Who will be your next character?

 A : Young Joseph, because he is my favorite JoJo.


 Q : Is the Evil Dan mode or regular Dan mode better?

 A : Regular Dan may have subpar buttons, but Evil dan gets a lot of buffs, with the down
     side of his specials failing. So while Evil Dan is much stronger in comparison, his
     uncertainty of outcome makes him risky to play. I would say that for the more consistent
     players, regular Dan is better.
